# Scarecrow

Scarecrow is a Node.js chat bot speed project that learns when you talk to it. Scarecrow uses the [pos](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pos) module for part of speech tagging.

## Install

	git clone https://github.com/brannondorsey/scarecrow.git
	cd scarecrow-master
	npm install

## Usage

You can chat with Scarecrow directly from the command line. From inside of the `scarecrow-master/` directory run:

	node copycat.js
	
If scarecrow already has a brain (more soon), you can talk to it with:

	node index.js
